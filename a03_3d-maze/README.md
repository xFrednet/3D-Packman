## Documentation
We choose an entity component system as out game architecture. The documentation is found in [`.docs/ecs.md`](.docs/ecs.md) and is definitely worth a read. The lighting system with out addition of a attenuation is documented in [`.docs/lighting.md`](.docs/lighting.md). Have fun reading them :D.
